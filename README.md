This project includes training of five different models with five different machine learning algorithms, used to predict the five different diseases such as:
> Brain Tumor Prediction
> Heart Health Prediction
> Diabetic Prediction
> Lung Health Prediction
> Chest HealthÂ Prediction

Algorithms used for building these models and accuracies are:
> KNN for Lung cancer [ Accuracy: 100%]
> CNN for Brain Tumor, Chest X-Ray [ Accuracy: 93%,95%]
> Random Forest for Diabetic Prediction [ Accuracy: 96%]
> Logistic Regression for Heart Health Prediction [ Accuarcy: 92%]
